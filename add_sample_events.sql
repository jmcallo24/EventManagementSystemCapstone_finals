-- CLEAN SETUP - NO DUMMY DATA
-- Run this AFTER setting up the main database
-- ===================================================================

-- This file is intentionally left clean.
-- No dummy/sample data will be inserted.
-- 
-- Your calendar will be empty initially, which is what you wanted.
-- You can create real events through:
-- 1. Organizer Dashboard (for organizers)
-- 2. Event Request Form (for participants)
--
-- Tables are ready, just no fake data.

SELECT 'Database setup complete - No dummy data added. Ready for real events!' as message;
